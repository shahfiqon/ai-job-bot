**About Stripe**
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
  
  
**About The Team**
Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
  
  
What you’ll do
  
  
As a company, we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open-source software.
  
  
**Responsibilities**

* Work on cross-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
* Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
* Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
  
  
**Minimum Requirements**

* A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
* Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
* Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
* Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts

**Preferred Qualifications**

* One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
* Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
* Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases

In-office expectations
  
  
Office-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
