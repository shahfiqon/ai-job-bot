**About Stripe**
 Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.
   

  

**About The Team**
 Stripe offers an interesting middle ground between joining a small startup and going to work for a multinational company. We have systems and processes optimized for early\\-career professionals. You will be in an environment that prizes rigor, discipline, and reliability—from our products, from our ways of working, and from our colleagues. You will learn how the best teams put together extremely reliable systems, and you will be responsible for operating these systems, with adequate backup when things get tough.
   

  

 What you’ll do
   

  

 As a company, we believe in end\\-to\\-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can. This helps ensure that we're building what users actually want. We contribute back to the community, often by building things we think are cool and by releasing open\\-source software.
   

  

**Responsibilities**
* Work on cross\\-functional projects, directly collaborating with other engineers
* Give meaningful feedback on code reviews and technical designs
* Ensure that the systems your team operates continue running well and can scale to meet the needs of our users
* Build the skills to own a project from beginning to end, learning project management and technical leadership skills


 Who you are
   

  

 We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
   

  

**Minimum Requirements**
* A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science or a directly related field, obtained by summer 2026, or equivalent work experience
* Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
* Experience from either previous internships or working collaboratively on multi\\-person coding projects (in a university or professional setting)
* Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts


**Preferred Qualifications**
* One or more areas of specialized knowledge balanced with general skills and knowledge, such as knowing more frontend technologies and, at a high level, how a service handles an HTTP request
* Experience in code review practices, and an understanding of how to safely update production systems
* Familiarity with navigating and managing work in large code bases


 In\\-office expectations
   

  

 Office\\-assigned Stripes in most of our locations are currently expected to spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This expectation may vary depending on role, team and location. For example, Stripes in our Bucharest, Romania site have an 80% in\\-office expectation, and those in Stripe Delivery Center roles in Mexico City, Mexico and Bengaluru, India work 100% from the office. Also, some teams have greater in\\-office attendance requirements, to appropriately support our users and workflows, which the hiring manager will discuss. This approach helps strike a balance between bringing people together for in\\-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility when possible.
   

  

 Pay and benefits
   

  

 The annual US base salary range for this role is $122,100 \\- $134,400\\. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.
   

  

 Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.","Software Development, Financial Services, and Technology, Information and Internet","https://www.linkedin.com/company/stripe","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D560BAQE2ZfJyfn-VCg/company-logo_100_100/B56ZlyKwpUKIAQ-/0/1758557047806/stripe_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=fRMcaMGPJNFUMq_l1f2zzyX4PaK3yg-MRicyUuY3qSI","","","","","","","","","","",""

 At Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face today is data quality. The success of any AI application relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and time\\-consuming. We’re here to change that.
   

  

 As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we started Encord.
   

  

 We are a talented and ambitious team of 90\\+, working at the cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y Combinator, we’re one of the fastest\\-growing companies in our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand our Engineering team to help us in building a better product for our customers.
   

  

**Who We Are Looking For**
 We're looking for an outstanding engineer to push our platform to the next level. You'll join us at a crucial stage of accelerated development for the company, product and team. As part of a small, highly collaborative group, you'll drive our product and team to new heights.
   

  

 Encord is growing rapidly, with our product as the key driver of that growth. A year ago, we were a team of 25; now, we’re 60 and continuing to accelerate.
   

  

**What To Expect**
* High performing team: You'll join the small team that has built a product that our customers love and consistently rate as the best in the market. Members of the team are veterans of both Big Tech and successful startups. While the team is more than a sum of its parts, every member on the team is impressive on their own.
* Impact: Your work will have direct and tangible impact for customers and in turn noticeably affect the trajectory of the company.
* End\\-to\\-end ownership: You will be entrusted with end\\-to\\-end ownership of your projects. From product, design and architectural decisions, all the way to deployment, monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work across the stack, covering everything from deployment to styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be proactive in problem\\-solving, and continuously seek improvements.
* Autonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive your work forward. But as a lean and high trust team, we remain quick to collaborate and support each other with challenging problems together.
* Scale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.


**About You**
* Are experienced: You have seen a lot and built a lot compared to your peers. You have personally developed and maintained multiple systems from scratch and you know what trade offs are involved in building reliable, performant software at speed.
* Seek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible outcome for people. You're not satisfied when building products that do not see the light of day or move a number by a tenth of a percent.
* Are a builder: You enjoy all aspects of building not only software but a complete product and are comfortable moving across the stack when necessary. You enjoy problem solving and thinking from first principles. You’re ready to pick up new skills and build quickly.
* Are comfortable with uncertainty: You're happy to tackle problems without a predefined clear definition or obvious solution, and are excited to have autonomy to make decisions as you go.
* Are a team player: You understand that being a member of a high\\-performing team requires two things. You contribute your best work. You also help others contribute their best. You enjoy lending a helping hand when needed and levelling up those around you.


**Tech stack**
 We are technology agnostic at Encord. We are not looking for you to have experience in all these technologies. As long as you're open to learning, please apply.

 At Dalus, we're building AI\\-powered software to reimagine how complex hardware systems are designed — think rockets, satellites, EVs, aircraft, nuclear plants.
   

  

 Right now, companies building these systems are held back by legacy tools that were never built for today’s fast\\-paced engineering teams. We’re changing that. Our platform makes hardware development faster, safer, and more scalable, even with smaller teams.
   

  

 We believe that designing atoms should feel more like working with bits — and that the next industrial renaissance needs better software.

* Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience)


****Desired Multipliers****
* Experience in aerospace, robotics, or hardware\\-software systems
* Exposure to TypeScript, Go, or C/C\\+\\+
* Open\\-source contributions or relevant side projects


 The pay range for this role is:
 ****$130,000 \\- $160,000****

**The stated compensation range reflects only the targeted base salary range in the**

 You do not need to match every listed expectation to apply for this position. Here at Astra, we know that diverse perspectives foster the innovation we need to be successful, and we are committed to building a team that encompasses a variety of backgrounds, experiences, and skills.

 Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.
   

  

 In\\-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in\\-office workdays.
   

  

**About The Role**
 Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. The Developer Experience team is responsible for architecting, implementing, and scaling the tools and frameworks that Notion developers use to build Notion. We are looking for engineers who are passionate about solving engineering productivity challenges, have deep empathy for other developers, and love to communicate with engineers. You don't need to have experience in this domain but willing to advocate for developer experience is the key.
   

  

**What You'll Achieve**
* Collaborate with engineers across the company to deliver an industry\\-leading developer experience, along the way working deeply with tools like the TypeScript language server, lint tooling, and the Notion CLI to improve developers’ day to day experience.
* Work on the bleeding edge of tooling performance, researching and evaluating new tools and keeping up with new developments in the developer experience space in the JS ecosystem.
* Work deeply with GitHub and our CI systems to help ensure engineers can merge their code quickly and safely. We aim for all PR CI pipelines to finish within 15 minutes!
* Take ownership of our development environment and toolchain, and contribute to novel projects across the company to deliver impact.


**Skills You'll Need To Bring**
* A drive to make developers’ lives better: you have a strong interest in keeping engineers in their flow state through better tooling. You like to think critically about the workflows engineers use in their day to day work, finding bottlenecks and thinking outside of the box to find ways to pave a better golden path for engineers to follow.
* A focus on user experience: you bring care and craft to the user experience you build into your products. Your work emphasizes simplicity, supportability, and ease\\-of\\-use, and you communicate clearly with other teams and engineers to get feedback on where we can improve.
* Multitasker and present: you like interrupts especially if this is blocking engineers.You switch between your project work and day to day developer experience challenges.
* Interest in learning how things work: you love to learn how the tools you use work at a fundamental level. You get excited at the idea of digging into third\\-party source code to understand how they work and find new ways to use them.
* Pragmatic and business\\-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.


**Nice To Haves**
* Familiarity with TypeScript, especially in ways to keep it running smoothly in a large codebase.
* An interest in automated testing and familiarity with testing best practices
* Past experience with React and common tooling like React Testing Library
* Past experience on developer experience teams or related tools
